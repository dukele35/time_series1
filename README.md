# Time Series Forecast for Ozone Level: Applications of Exponential Smoothing & ARIMA models

## Project Summary
* The project is to apply the two most widely-used approaches, i.e. Exponential Smoothing & ARIMA, for time series forecast.
* Ozone dataset is the subject of the experiment. The dataset is obtained from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Ozone+Level+Detection).
* Theoretical concepts of the two approaches are discussed so that approriate versions of Exponential Smoothings & ARIMAs are logically selected for the given dataset. 
* Protocol of time series forecast is proposed. It includes:
  * EDA 
  * Time Series Decomposition 
  * Auto-Correlation Assessment 
  * Applications of appropriate versions of Exponential Smoothings & ARIMAs
  * Cross validation of forecasts to calculate models' mean-squared errors
  * Choosing the best models.
* The details of the project is documented in the [pdf](https://github.com/dukele35/time_series1/blob/master/report_timeseries1.pdf) file and the webpage.
